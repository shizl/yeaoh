-- SUMMARY --

The spritesheets module provides an easy means of image aggregation to cut down 
on http requests and decrease page load times.


-- REQUIREMENTS --

None.


-- INSTALL --

* Normal Drupal module install

* pngcrush can be used to optimize the spritesheet, and can be obtained from 
  http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/ and placed in sites/all/libraries/pngcrush


-- CONFIGURATION --

* Configure Spritesheets settings at admin/config/spritesheets 


-- USE --

Spritesheets relies heavily on how the css it is given is written. By following 
a few rules, you can help prevent strange things from happening to your sprites.

 - Inheritance is used to fill in missing information regarding background 
   images:

    .parentclass { background-image: ... }
    .parentclass.childclass { background-position: -32px 0 }
    .parentclass.childclass.childclasstwo { background-image: ... }

   parentclass will use its background image at 0, 0
   childclass will use parentclass' background image at -32px, 0
   childclasstwo will use its own background image at -32px, 0

 - Spritesheets can incorporate other spritesheets easily, but it needs to be 
   written in a certain logical manner:
   
    a.link { background-image: url(image.png); }
    a:hover { background-position: -32px 0; }
   
   This may work in a browser, but as far Spritesheets is concerned they are 
   irrelevant to each other. To have this a:hover work for a.link specifically, 
   be sure to share selectors up until the end:

    a.link:hover { ... }

 - Large images and photographs are highly recommended to keep out of the
   spritesheet, as this dramatically increases the file size of the sheet, and 
   defeats the purpose of making faster page loads.
